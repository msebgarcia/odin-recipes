        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
             <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: First we make the meatballs. I made them in the food processor, I put the bread soaked in milk, the vegetables and I processed them. Then I added the cheese, seasonings, and ground beef. Everything was mixed, I made balls the size of a tablespoon of soup, passed them through flour and cooked them fried. Reserve.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Then I prepared the sauce in a large-mouth frying pan and saut√©ed the carrots, onion and bell pepper.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: When everything was very tender, I added the white wine. And then the diced tomato.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: I let it cook for half an hour and then I added the meatballs that are integrated with the sauce. If they see that the liquid is consumed during cooking, they add hot water.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Finally, as I made them with white rice in another pot, I boiled two and a half glasses of water with salt to taste. When it boiled, I added the rice, it was cooked for 15 minutes</li>
             <li><strong>Step 6</strong>: Then I turn it off and let it rest, it is not necessary to strain it and the grains detach well from each other.</li>
             <li><strong>Step 7</strong>: In a bowl I put the rice and on top the meatballs in sauce. Enjoy.</li>
